<p align="center"><font face='Arial,Helvetica,adobe-helvetica,Arial Narrow' size="5" color="#000000">Albinism</font></p>

<p>An albino is an organism exhibiting deficient or absent pigmentation in the skin, hair&nbsp;and eyes. &nbsp;The classical abino has no melanin pigment at all, resulting in white
hair,&nbsp;white/pink skin and pink or light blue/grey eyes. &nbsp;There are also many forms of incomplete albinism where pigment is present in reduced amounts or is only produced under certain
conditions. &nbsp;Since melanin is required for proper development of the eye, albinos often have moderate to severe vision problems.</p>

<p class="smcaps"><a name="TARG"><br>
<b>Biochemistry in Brief</b></a></p>

<p>There is a gene present in most animals that codes for an enzyme called tyrosinase. &nbsp;The job of tyrosinase is to start the transformation of the amino acid tyrosine on its way to becoming
melanin pigment. &nbsp;After many steps, tyrosine ends up either as brown-black eumelanin or as yellow-red pheomelanin. &nbsp;Many other genes can affect this pigment-making process at any number of
points &mdash; interrupting its completion, changing the relative amounts of the two pigments, allowing only one kind of pigment &mdash; but without tyrosinase, these are irrelevant.</p>

<p class="smcaps"><a name="TARG"><br>
<b>The Full Color Genotype</b></a></p>

<p>In genetics laboratories, the tyrosinase locus is symbolized <b>tyr</b>. &nbsp;Outside of labs, we usually call it <b>C</b> for "color." &nbsp;Since every individual has two genes for each locus,
most often there are two copies of <b>C</b>. &nbsp;The animal's genotype is <b>CC</b> and it has "full color", exhibiting whatever color is mandated by the rest of the genes that affect pigment and
its distribution.</p>

<p><img src="a_peat.jpg" width="158" height="158" hspace="10" border="0" align="right" alt="">If an animal has inherited a defective <b>C</b> gene that functions inadequately or not at all, then it
only has one normal copy of the gene. &nbsp;As it happens, one copy is sufficient to generate enough tyrosinase to make all the necessary pigment, so an animal with one normal <b>C</b> and one
abnormal <b>C</b> is indistinguishable in appearance from one with <b>CC</b>.* &nbsp;In this case, we say that <b>C</b> is completely dominant over the defective gene. &nbsp;Conversely, the defective
gene is recessive to the normal one.<img src="a_bill.jpg" width="158" height="134" hspace="10" border="0" align="right" alt=""></p>

<p>To the right are two Golden Syrians both with only one normal tyrosinase gene. &nbsp;Top: &nbsp;shorthair female. &nbsp;Bottom: &nbsp;longhair male. &nbsp;Here the longhair itself dilutes the
color, but this is unrelated to albinism.</p>

<p><small>*This is not universally true. &nbsp;See <a href="#cremello">Cremello</a>. &nbsp;Also, it is known that mice of certain colors are slightly lighter if they have only one full-functioning
<b>C</b> gene.</small></p>

<p class="smcaps"><a name="TARG"><br>
<b>Classical Albinism</b></a></p>

<p>A mutation in <b>C</b> resulting in useless or completely absent tyrosinase is called <b>c</b>. &nbsp;In a <b>Cc</b> animal, one gene is cranking out all the tyrosinase needed to make pigment
while its partner on the sister chromosome contributes nothing. &nbsp;This becomes significant only when two <b>Cc</b> animals mate. &nbsp;Then there is a 25% chance that any progeny will be <b>
cc</b>. &nbsp;Since tyrosinase is the first gate to melanin pigment production, none is produced anywhere. &nbsp;Hair is white. &nbsp;Skin and eyes are pink since there is no melanin to cover the red
heme in blood. &nbsp;These are the classical albinos.</p>

<p>Classical albinism is present in many, if not most, mammalian species. &nbsp;In humans, about 1 in 70 people carry the gene, leading to an incidence of albinism of roughly 1 in 18,000. &nbsp;In
Syrian hamsters, however, the mutation has not been recognized, if it has occurred.</p>

<p class="smcaps"><br>
<b>Partial Albinism</b></p>

<p>When the tyrosinase gene is less than totally disabled, varying amounts of pigment can be present. &nbsp;The intensity of color and its distribution depend on the specific mutation. &nbsp;In mice
there are well over a dozen known C locus mutations that are not <b>c</b> types. &nbsp;Some have arisen spontaneously in laboratory strains; others have been induced by irradiation or chemical
mutatgens. &nbsp;Three are in the mouse fancy gene pool. &nbsp;These are called chinchilla, extreme dilution and himalayan (siamese). &nbsp;Up until recently, only one partial albino gene, Dark Eared
White, &nbsp;was known in Syrian hamsters. &nbsp;Now, extreme dilution has also been identified.</p>

<p class="smcaps"><a name="TARG"><br>
<b>Dark Eared White (c<sup><font>d</font></sup>)</b></a></p>

<p><img src="a_higgins.jpg" width="216" height="252" hspace="10" border="0" align="right" alt="">The C locus gene called Dark Eared White was discovered in the U.S. in 1952. &nbsp;It produces a
partial albino phenotype when homozygous. &nbsp;It is sometimes referred to as acromelanic albino, meaning "color at the tips", but this term is also used for the temperature-sensitive tyrosinase
genes, usually called himalayan or siamese. &nbsp;Ear color in Dark Eared White hamsters is not dependent on temperature.</p>

<p>A <b>c<sup><font>d</font></sup>c<sup><font>d</font></sup></b> hamster has a snow white coat, red eyes and dark grey ears. The ear color is absent at birth, developing at about 30 days of age.</p>

<p class="smcaps"><br>
<b>The Syrian Fake Albino</b></p>

<p><img src="a_johnny.jpg" width="216" height="147" hspace="10" border="0" align="right" alt="">When hamster aficionados say that there is no Syrian albino, they mean that there is no classical
albinism in the species. &nbsp;There is a phenotype though that fools people into thinking it's albino since there is no visible pigmentation. &nbsp;It is Flesh Eared White which is a combination of
Dark Eared White and Cinnamon. &nbsp;Cinnamon prevents pigment formation in the ears; Dark Eared White prevents it everywhere else.</p>

<p class="smcaps"><br>
<b>Exreme Dilution (c<sup><font>e</font></sup>)</b></p>

<p><img src="a_eds.jpg" width="216" height="217" hspace="10" border="0" align="right" alt="">Mice homozygous for extreme dilution have very light grey hair and black eyes. &nbsp;The mutation was
found in the wild. &nbsp;Eumelanin is strongly reduced, and pheomelanin is nearly absent. &nbsp;In Syrian hamsters the mutation is believed to have originated in a commercial hamstery along the U.S.
east coast in 1999. &nbsp;Homozygotes have a light grey agouti coat with black ticking, dark grey ears and black eyes with a red glow. &nbsp;For more information see <a href="dilute.htm">Extreme
Dilute Syrian Hamsters</a>.</p>

<p>Although no other C locus alleles are known in Syrian hamsters, there are several others that are commonly found in mammalian species. &nbsp;Each variation has similarities across species lines,
but there is not great consistency in names or symbol assignment. &nbsp;A few of the most common are described here.</p>

<p class="smcaps"><br>
<b>Chinchilla (usually c<sup><font>ch</font></sup>)</b></p>

<p>Chinchillated animals have a slight reduction in black pigment and greatly diminished yellow pigment. &nbsp;This generally results in a grey coat that lacks the golden or brown tones of the wild
type. &nbsp;Confusing the issue is the use of the term to&nbsp;describe fur that has this look but is from different causes.</p>

<p class="smcaps"><br>
<b>Himalayan (or Siamese) (usually c<sup><font>h</font></sup> or c<sup><font>s</font></sup>)</b></p>

<p>Both these terms refer to tyrosinase mutations that are heat labile. &nbsp;At body temperature, the enzyme is disabled so that very little pigment is formed in central body locations. &nbsp;At the
periphery, where the tissues are cooler, pigment can be produced in nearly normal amounts. &nbsp;These areas are called the "points" and include ears, nose, feet, tail base and scrotum. &nbsp;Animals
kept in cold environments will have more color. &nbsp;This happens also in the wild during the winter season. &nbsp;Most homozygotes have white or light tan fur with brown or black points.</p>

<p class="smcaps"><a name="blueeyed"><br>
<b>Blue-eyed Albino (c<sup><font>a</font></sup>)</b></a></p>

<p>In felines and mice this gene produces almost complete albinism.&nbsp;The animals have a translucent white coat and washed-out, pale blue eyes.</p>

<p class="smcaps"><a name="cremello"><br>
<b>Cremello (c<sup><font>cr</font></sup>)</b></a></p>

<p>The equine palomino gene is also called cream or cremello. &nbsp;It is unusual in that it is codominant to <b>C</b>. &nbsp;Horses with one <b>c<sup>cr</sup></b> are palomino. &nbsp;With two, they are
cremello &mdash; very pale cream, almost white, with white mane and tail and blue eyes.</p>

<p class="smcaps"><br>
<b>Intermediate and Combination Forms</b></p>

<p>Any individual can have any two-allele combination of these C locus genes, depending on what is in its species gene pool. &nbsp;Leaving aside <b>C</b>, the combinations are usually intermediate in
appearance between the homozygous forms. &nbsp;In the case of himalayan, the combination form has points.</p>

<p>Some of the albino family genes completely mask other colors. &nbsp;No matter what the rest of the genotype codes for, the fur of a classical albino will always be pure white. &nbsp;This is also
true of a Dark Eared White Syrian hamster. &nbsp;However, the forms of partial albino that allow some fur pigmentation can interact with the underlying color to form shades that differ. &nbsp;The
above descriptions refer to animals that are wild type except at the C locus.</p>
